# jobtank_backend
The jobtank is a web app aimed at reducing the information gap between recruiters and potential applicants. Recruiters therefore register/login and post jobs. The jobs are the main feed of the app and are accessed by all visitors. The jobs have all the information about them as specified by the recruiters.

This is a node.js backend for my project the jobtank. it has a jobs api, recruiters api - for registering recruiters and an auth api - that authenticates recruiters
